# Commit = all missing + server code

When the user says "commit":
- Stage and commit **all** uncommitted changes in the repo (frontend, backend/server, and any other project code).
- Do not leave any modified project files uncommitted unless the user explicitly asks to exclude something.
- Use a descriptive commit message; ask for one if the change set is large or unclear.
